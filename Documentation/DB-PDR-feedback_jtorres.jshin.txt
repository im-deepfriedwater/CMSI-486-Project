This is simply an awesome job!

The ERD is very nice.  Only two things need addressing:
1) what is the association between "market" and "food_item"?  Perhaps for
   the detailed design, include a diamond relationship called "has" or
   "sells"
2) make sure you underline the primary key for the food_item entity

Great work.

Total: 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.
